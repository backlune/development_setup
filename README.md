# My development setup
This repo is placeholder for my current developement setup. I try to keep it update to be able to quickly get back to a dev environment with my configuration when replacing computer or 
for other reasons need to redo my setup.


## Visual studio
Currently I'm actively trying out new core extension as both Resharper (which I left a few years ago) and CodeRush seems to slow things down a lot and VS is not having many of the 
same funcitons built-in.

- Open In Editor
